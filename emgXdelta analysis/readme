# Delta-EMG Analysis Pipeline

This MATLAB project processes EEG and EMG recordings in two temporal blocks. It extracts spectral and statistical features, clusters EMG activity using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), and analyzes the interaction between EEG delta power and EMG muscle activity.

## 🧠 Project Description

- EEG and EMG signals are band-pass filtered (0.5–50 Hz for EEG, 20–50 Hz for EMG).
- Signals are segmented into 5-second epochs.
- For each epoch:
  - **Power Spectral Density (PSD)** is calculated via Welch's method.
  - Relative power in 5 bands is computed: delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma.
  - **EMG RMS** is used for GMM-based clustering of muscle activity (5 levels).
- The product of delta power × EMG cluster centroids is computed and exported for visualization.

## 🧰 Requirements

- MATLAB R2020b or later
- Required toolboxes:
  - Signal Processing Toolbox
  - Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure all `.mat` files and `delta_EMG_analysis.m` are in the same directory.
2. Open MATLAB.
3. Navigate to the directory.
4. Run:
   ```matlab
   delta_EMG_analysis
   ```

The script will:

- Filter the signals
- Segment them into epochs
- Extract power and RMS features
- Cluster EMG data
- Plot histograms and save analysis results

## 📂 Demo Data

This demo dataset includes synthetic or anonymized recordings labeled as:

- EEG\_first\_block.mat
- EEG\_second\_block.mat
- EMG\_first\_block.mat
- EMG\_second\_block.mat

> Each `.mat` file contains a variable named either `EEG_first_block`, `EEG_second_block`, `EMG_first_block`, or `EMG_second_block`.
